# Nucleo STM32F303K8 Rust Example
This project is an example configuration for building (using `cargo build`) and 
uploading (using `openocd`) a Rust program to the 
[STM32F303K8 Nucleo Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f303k8.html).
This project depends on the STM32F3xx HAL Wrapper provided
[here](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f3xx-hal). The project is configured 
using IntelliJ's CLion.
